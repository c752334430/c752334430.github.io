## What is Rabbit MQ (message queue)

[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfVddTJNiAw)

Think when we have webpage -> server -> DB.

When the website server is overloaded, say it's shutdown, then all the upcoming requests are lost. 

Instead user's request now is sent to messsage broker. Broker "cache" the request into a queue and let the user do his job. Broker then in sequence sending requests from the queue to the server to process.

Reconsider the situation when the server is down. Now requests are saved in the broker, waiting until the server is back online. It increases the resilience. 

What's the additional benefit? Instead of binding a request/user with one server, now we can have a bunch of servers, waiting for requests being distributed by the broker. Thus it scales the frontend and backend by disconnect the direct connection between them.
